	    <h1>Foods That Harm Your Heart</h1>
		<p>
	      The following foods are bad for your heart and you need to limit them as much as you can: 
	    </p>
		<strong>Saturated fat</strong>
		<p>  
        Whereas polyunsaturated fats (omega-3) are good for your heart, foods high in saturated fats such as mayonnaise, palm oil, dairy based foods (butter, full cream milk, sour cream, cheese), coconut oil, coconut milk, fatty parts of most of the meat can block your arteries, the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to your heart and other parts of the body. These can elevate blood cholesterol levels leading to atherosclerosis, a disease where plaque inside your arteries blocks their vital functions leading to heart disease. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting saturated fat so it comprises less than 7% of your total daily caloric intake.		  
		</p>
		<strong>Added sugars</strong>
		<p>
		Sugar-sweetened beverages such as sodas, energy drinks, and sports drinks are by far the biggest sources of added sugar in the average American’s diet. Other important sources include cookies, cakes, pastries, and ice cream, frozen yogurt and candy and ready-to-eat cereals and pasta sources. Control yourself from over consumption of these kind of foods otherwise you are  more likely going to develop hypertension, obesity, higher level of triglyceride in the blood and are at high risk of developing heart diseases.
        </p>
		<p>
            Over the course of the 15-year study, participants who took in 25% or more of their daily calories as sugar were more than twice as likely to die from heart disease as those whose diets included less than 10% added sugar. Overall, the odds of dying from heart disease rose in tandem with the percentage of sugar in the diet and that was true regardless of a person’s age, sex, physical activity level, and <a href="blood-pressure-bmi-check-up.html"> BMI </a>. 
		
		</p>
		
		<strong>Salt</strong>
		<p>
		  Avoid taking high-sodium diets. The excess sodium will hold more water in your body raising your blood pressure. Higher the blood pressure, the greater the strain on your heart, arteries, kidneys and brain leading to heart attacks, strokes, dementia and kidney disease. American Heart Association  recommends limiting salt intake no more than 1,500 mg daily.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Most Importantly, some foods i.e. cereals, breads etc. that don’t taste salty can still be high in sodium. It is wiser not to use taste as a guide. In addition, always check the label of frozen meals, packaged soups, breads, dressings/sauces, and snacks, choose only those with low in sodium. Avoid or limit as much as possible salty foods like nuts, snack products such as chips and pretzels, seeds. Select unsalted or low-sodium labeled nuts, snacks  to protect your heart.

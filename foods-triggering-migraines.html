	    <h1>Foods Triggering Migraines</h1>
		<p>
		 Foods Triggering Migraines : Do you know about those foods? Do you keep a headache journal to identify whether certain foods triggering your pain? Have you ever tried to see whether the removal or reduction of certain foods from your diet improves your headaches?
        </p>
		<p>
		  Remember its never too late to know your migraine triggers and handle the pain with ease.
        </p> 
		<p>
          A migraine headache is characterized by intense throbbing in one area of the head. Patients with migraine also experiences nausea, depression, sleep disturbances. They may have extreme sensitivity to light and sound with blurred vision (the aura phase). 		
		</p> <br>
	<p><u>Here are some facts</u>:
	    <ul class="recentpost">

         <li>According to WHO, migraine is one of the 20 most disabling medical illness of the world</li>
         <li>More than 1 in 10 Americans have migraines</li>
         <li>Women are 3  times more likely to have it than men</li>
         <li>Up to 90% of people with migraines have a family history that means if one or both of your parents have migraines you are most likely to get it</li>
         <li>Many women experiences migraines either a few days earlier or during their menstrual cycle. A sharp decline in the female hormone estrogen during this period may contribute to it</li>
         <li>People having a history of aura phase are at increased risk of stroke and heart attack.</li>
	    </ul>
	</p>
    <p> The following foods and drinks may trigger migraines in some people but not everyone:</p>
       <ul class="recentpost">
	   
          <li><strong>Nitrates and nitrites</strong> used as preservatives in processed meats such as hot dogs, bacon, and lunch meats. These two things may dilate blood vessels and to trigger headaches in some people</li>
          <li><strong>Monosodium glutamate,</strong> a flavor enhancer, often found in soy sauce and used as a food additive in many other foods. This salt may cause migraines in 10 to 15% of people. The high salt concentration in this sauce may cause dehydration which in turn can trigger migraines</li>
          <li><strong>Phenylethylamines,</strong> found in chocolates, aged cheeses, beans, certain nuts, beer and red wines</li>
		  <li><strong>Caffeine</strong> even in very small amount may be a trigger for some people</li>
		  <li><strong>Alcoholic beverages</strong> especially red wine, beer and sherry</li>
        
		</ul>
	</p>
		 
         <p><u>
         Keeping  a daily journal about your headache helps pinpointing  the triggers:</u> 
		 <p>Every time you have a headache, write down the in your headache journal
		  what you ate and drank in the past 24 hours,what time your headache started and how long it persisted, where you were and what were you doing, the intensity of the pain and its side effects,
          how much sleep you had the previous night,if you are a female, whether you were menstruating or not.
		</p>
		<p>Keeping this journal may help you or your doctor to identify the trigger(s) and improve your treatment option.</p>
		<p>Remember prevention is better than cure. Therefore, make a habit of taking healthy foods, donâ€™t skip meals, and avoid foods triggering migraines.</p>

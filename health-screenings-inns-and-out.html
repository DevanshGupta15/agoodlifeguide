	    <h1>Health Screenings' Inns and Out</h1>
		<p>
	     Go for the following  health screening procedures and live well:   
        <p><br>
		 <strong>SCREEN FOR DIABETES</strong> 
		 <p><u>When to get it:</u> </p>
		 Starting at 45 go for it once in every three years.

         <p>
		   But the American Diabetes Association advises to go for it earlier if you’re overweight and have one or more of these risk factors:  have a family member with diabetes or delivered a baby over 9 pounds or had gestational diabetes or have high blood pressure or belong to an ethnic group with higher rates of diabetes, such as African Americans, Hispanics or Native Americans.
         </p><br>
		 <strong>EYE EXAM</strong>
        <p>
         As you get older, you’re at risk for conditions such as glaucoma, which is symptom- less but can make you blind. An eye exam can find signs of another disease that may be affecting your eyes, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.
        </p>
        <p><u>When to get it:</p></u> 
		
		<p>
		 Starting at your 20,  go for this health screening procedure every 5 to 10 years but yearly in case of using contact lens.
        
         At age 40, you should do it every 2 years. You may need more frequent exams if you have a family history of eye disease or have had previous eye injuries or eye surgery or have diabetes or high blood pressure or you are over 65.
        </p><br>
        <strong>SKIN EXAM</strong>

        <p>
		  Examining your skin by a dermatologist for suspicious changes such as abnormal growths, moles or lesions over your scalp, genitals, skin as well as between your toes can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. Go for it as early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.
        </p>  
        <p><u>When to get it:</u></p> 
		<p>
		People having a history of abnormal moles, sunburns, living in sunny climates, being fair or a family history of skin cancer are very much susceptible to get this disease and thus requires skin examination in every 3-6 months. For others, once a year should be fine. 
		</p><br>
		<strong>COLONOSCOPY</strong>
        <p>
        Colonoscopy to examine for ulcers, polyps, tumors, and areas of inflammation or bleeding in your colon is the best defense against colon cancer, the third most common cancer in both men and women.
        </p>
        <p><u>When to get it:</u></p>   
		<p>
		 At age 50 but  earlier if you’ve got other risk factors, such as a family history or if you have suspicious symptoms like blood in your stool. If the test is negative, continue getting one in every 10 years.
        </p><br>
 

        <strong>TSH (THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE) TEST</strong>
        <p>
        Thyroid hormones produced in thyroid gland control the overall metabolism of our body. Half of those who are afflicted with thyroid disorder don’t even know they have it and thus heading to serious health problems. If you have symptoms such as fatigue, unexplained weight gain, go to get your blood level of TSH checked.
        </p>
        <p><u>When to get it:</u></p>   
		<p>
		The Thyroid Foundation of America recommends that women receive TSH test starting at age 50, and men at 60 annually. They also recommend that anyone with a family history of testing positive for thyroid disease or other autoimmune disorders should have their thyroid function evaluated every five years after the age of 35.
